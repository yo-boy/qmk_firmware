potential

gaston: seems good to take from and lower complexity

ninjonas: lower seems promising

cykedev:look at and learn how adjust works, also dot and comma on mods, for apex ping too

datadavd: power keys and 'more keys' on one layer

domnantas: keypad

mikefightsbears: same navigation on both layers

muuko: just two layers?

yshrsmz: remove right shift? also top layer row

yuchi: one function one number layer



me: move backspace left. maybr swap layer keys anf ones next to them
navigation layer on right hand, functions on left hand layer

add a function layer instead of right gui

shift on a thumb key

maybe add " on a layer or fix the shift

add a control on the right half

function row instead of nums on top row in both layers
